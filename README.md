Developed a phishing URL and spam detection system based on machine learning models for enhanced cybersecurity. The project consisted of extracting 31 key features from URLs and applying NLP techniques for spam email/SMS preprocessing. Several classification algorithms were compared, and the best models were used in a Flask-based web application. The application gives real-time classification through a user-friendly interface, which includes feature-rich analysis and secure REST API endpoints. This system provides a scalable solution to identify and mitigate phishing and spam threats effectively.
This project focuses on building a robust phishing URL and spam detection system by using advanced machine learning techniques to address growing cybersecurity threats. The system identifies malicious URLs and spam messages by analyzing extracted features rather than using traditional URL or content analysis methods. For phishing URL detection, 31 critical features were derived, capturing structural, security, and page-quality characteristics. For spam email and SMS classification, NLP techniques had been used to preprocess textual content effectively.

Multiple classification algorithms were implemented and evaluated for their accuracy, precision, and overall performance. The Gradient Boosting Classifier emerged as the most effective model for phishing URL detection, while spam classification leveraged optimized NLP-based models. Both models were integrated into a real-time web application developed using Flask, offering users a seamless interface to test URLs and SMS/emails.

The application uses REST API endpoints for secure communication and allows efficient scalability for larger datasets. Visualization techniques such as feature distribution plots and heatmaps have been used to gain insights from the dataset and validate the importance of features. Through the combination of feature-rich analysis, machine learning models, and an intuitive web interface, this project delivers a powerful tool for mitigating phishing and spam threats, which promises a safer online environment for both users and organizations.
